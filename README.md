# Clear Checkout WooCommerce
## Description.
PoC (proof of concept) Wordpress plugin for WooCommerce.
In practice, online store owners reduce the classic form of the checkout page. To speed up testing, I use my own woocommerce plugin. It allows you to remove the required fields and display only the necessary ones in a custom form. Of course, there are already ready-made solutions, but I'm happy to have my own, which I can customize and not pay extra money.

## Features.

* Ability to display the form through a shortcode.
* Real order creation in the admin panel.
* Ability to customize and change the code.
* Low load and plugin on the server.

## Installation.
1. Download the plugin.
2. Go to **Plugins > Add New** in the WordPress admin.
3. Upload the plugin file and activate it.

## Settings.
Go to Settings > Clear Checkout in the WordPress admin.

## Here you can configure:

Insert the **[clear_checkout_form]** shortcode in the desired place to initialize the checkout form.

## Bottom line
Actually, this is a basic functional plugin for testing, but not yet for working on a production server.
